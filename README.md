## Introduction

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

NAMISC is an open-source PyTorch-based codebase for Semantic Communication. It borrows a lot of ideas from [XRNeRF](https://github.com/openxrlab/xrnerf).



This page provides basic tutorials about the usage of NAMISC(not written yet).

I have implemented DeepSC in this repository, and I need to test the metrics of this model. Moreover, some codes are not elegant enough, I need to refactor it.
